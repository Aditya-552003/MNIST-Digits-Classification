* Framework: TensorFlow / Keras 

* Model Type: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) / Dense Neural Network 

* Objective: Classify handwritten digit images into their respective numeric classes.

## Key Features
* Data loading and preprocessing

* Model building using deep learning

* Training and validation with performance metrics

* Visualization of accuracy and loss over epochs

* Model evaluation on test data

## Results
* Achieved an accuracy of 99.4% on the test dataset.

Model successfully recognizes handwritten digits from unseen data.
